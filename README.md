# Full stack course - Project 1, A Guestbook app - Riku Ruotsila
 
On the home page (and on the other pages as well) of the app, you can navigate to different pages on the app.

On the Guestbook page, you can view messages left by other people. The page shows their username, country, time and date of the message sent and the message itself.

On the New message page, you can leave a message to be put in the guestbook. You will need to fill all of the fields - username, country and message.

On the Ajax message page, you can also leave the same type of message but the backend works a bit differently. When submitting a message, it page will send an AJAX call and post it into the guestbook that way.
